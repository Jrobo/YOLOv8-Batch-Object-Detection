# YOLOv8-Batch-Object-Detection

Detect objects in multiple images using the latest YOLOv8 model with just a few lines of Python. This project is optimized for Google Colab and can be easily adapted for local use.

## Features

- Batch object detection on images in a folder
- Uses Ultralytics YOLOv8 (pretrained)
- Saves results with bounding boxes and class labels
- Minimal, efficient, and easy to use

## Getting Started

### 1. Run on Google Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/)

- Upload your images to the `/content/images` folder.
- Run the notebook cells.
- Annotated images will be saved in `/content/results`.

### 2. Local Usage

- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install ultralytics
  ```
- Place your images in the `images` folder.
- Run the script:
  ```bash
  python batch_detect.py
  ```

## Example

| Input Image | Output (Detected) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ![zidane.jpg](images/zidane.jpg) | ![zidane_output.webp](images/zidane_output.webp) |

### **How to Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces**

1. **Create a `app.py` file:**

````python
import gradio as gr
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')

def detect(image):
    results = model(image)
    return results[0].plot()  # Returns annotated image

gr.Interface(
    fn=detect,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="pil"),
    outputs=gr.Image(type="pil"),
    title="YOLOv8 Object Detection",
    description="Upload an image to detect objects using YOLOv8."
).launch()
